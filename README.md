# AirFair
<b>Authors:</b> Katherine Wadhwani, Murt Sayeed, Dan Vaccaro, Vanessa Venkataraman

<b>Purpose:</b> Automated ticket price analysis. AirFair takes usersâ€™ flight preferences and scrapes Expedia to find the best matches. We hope to soon deploy a version that emails users with our finds!

<b>Status:</b> AirFair is currently a work in progress, as we found that our webscraper broke when run on the cloud. For now, our webscraper is implemented locally but our web page is up and running. Checkout https://airfair.herokuapp.com/ and enter your email for a fun greeting!

<b>Implementation:</b> Our webscraper is written in Java and uses Selenium. The rest of our backend is written in PHP and deployed on Heroku.
